## ℹ️ About this project

This is a project that is a part of [Scrimba's Advanced React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/react) by Bob Ziroll.

This is part of a module, where we have to build a project while learning ReactJS.

The main goal of the project was to learn and practise `Event Listeners`, `Context`, `React Router`, `Hooks` and `PropTypes`.

I'd like to come back to this project later so I can learn and practise `localStorage` to save the items that were added to the cart.
